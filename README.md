# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-with-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries. It explores various aspects of the pandemic, including infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination statistics. The project's goal is to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and populations.
# Getting Started
Before running the SQL queries, ensure that you have the necessary data sources set up. The project uses data from the following sources:

['Covid Deaths$'] - COVID-19 cases and mortality data
['Covid Vaccinations$'] - COVID-19 vaccination data
CovidDiseases - Additional disease-related data

# Mortality Analysis
1. Calculate the mortality rate per country.
2. Analyze the total diagnosed cases and deaths.

# Infection Rate Analysis
1. Calculate the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
2. Identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their populations.

# High Death Counts
1. Identify countries with the highest death counts per population.
2. Analyze continents with the highest death counts per population.

# Vaccination Statistics
1. Calculate the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.
2. Visualize the rolling vaccination percentage over time.

# Global COVID-19 Statistics
1. Calculate the total COVID-19 cases per location and date.
2. Calculate the total cardiovascular deaths per location and date.
3. Calculate the average diabetes prevalence per location and date.
4. Analyze correlations between COVID-19 cases,
